# Hello World in Saxon JS 2 with web components

This branch is a variation on the `main` branch. You should get that branch working first.

Then you can switch to this branch and run the build steps again.

Whatâ€™s different about this branch is that it uses the [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/)] web-components
library to make the button.
